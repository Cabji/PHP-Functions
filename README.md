# PHP-Functions
A collection of functions I have written in PHP

fn-signValues.php - brute force function to determine if a combination of +/- values can yield a difference value. Used for analyzing bank statement transactions where opening and closing balanaces are available to determine if transaction values are credits or debits. (Used in project nabanal/pdfstatement2csv)
